## Data Flow:
 1. ### Models: 
    Created two Classes first is Student class along with properties like studentId, firstName, lastName, age, department and second class Event along with properties like eventId, eventName, locationOfEvent, date, startTime, endTime  and create a constructors, and getters and setters both of the classes.Using some validation with properties like @Id, @Pattern etc.
 1. ### Controllers: 
    *  Created two controller class StudentController and EventController class in which having mapping like @GetMapping,
    @PostMapping,@PutMapping,@DeleteMapping.Created  objects of StudentService class and EventService  through dependency injection using @Autowired annotation.

## Project Summary
In this spring boot application I had created API's mapping for CRUD operations like create(save), read(find), update and deleteÂ student and event. Aim of this project to using some validation, using the crudRepository method , createing and using custom finder method and custom query method in this project.
